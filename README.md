# Bootstrap Grid Playground

A small experiment from a few years ago to interactively add/remove Bootstrap rows and columns.

You can:
- Add/delete rows and columns
- Adjust column width with a slider
- Set column types like `-sm`, `-md`, etc.

Built with plain HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, and Bootstrap 4.
